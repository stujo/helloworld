## What is Source Code?
* Often looks a bit like english
* An explict description of (some aspect of) what the program should do
* Human readable with very specific syntax that means something specific to the compiler or interpretter
* Ruby, Python, JavaScript - Programming Languages - How the program should work
* HTML, YAML, Markdown - Markup Languages - Describe something about the program
* CSS - Style Description
* Question: Have you seen are some examples of Source Code you may have seen?

## Where is Source Code stored?
* In a source code control system like GIT or CVS
* It is versioned as it is updated
* A given version of the source code is used to build a release of the application
* Question: Do you have github account?
