# Intro to GitHub
We are going to use GitHub Pages to make and publish a webpage on the internet

# Setup
* Register on [github.com](https://github.com/)
* Create a new **Repository** called ``helloworld``
* Add a ``README.md`` - Add a description of what you are going to do in this repo

# Create Your Home Page
* ``Create new file`` -> ``index.html``
* We need a blank HTML document to start
* Just like a programmer : Google [``Blank HTML Document``](https://www.google.com/search?q=Blank+HTML+Document)
  * [https://www.wired.com/2010/02/blank_html_document/](https://www.wired.com/2010/02/blank_html_document/)
* Copy Paste like a Pro : Paste the HTML into your new file and Save
* This is your first [Source Code](https://www.google.com/search?q=Source%20Code) - High Five!

# Test it!
* In the real world we have things like Test Suites
* To begin we are just going to view it and see that it works

# GitHub Pages
* GitHub Pages is a simple way to host a ``static`` website on the internet
* In your repo go to ``Settings`` -> ``GitHub Pages``
* Choose the ``master`` branch as the source
* Right Click on the link -> ``Open in New Window`` to test your page
* Question: What do you see? - Let's fix any problems together
* If yours worked but your neighbour's did not, help them out [Pair Programming](https://www.google.com/search?q=Pair%20Programming)

# Edit the HTML File
* We want to maintain our coding guidelines!
* Edit the HTML file to include [CR/LF or newlines](https://www.google.com/search?q=CR/LF%20or%20newline) between each element
* Save the file
* Does it still work?
* Question: Do you have any bugs?
* Question: What would you like to change about your page?
